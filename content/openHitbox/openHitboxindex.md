# openHitbox

openHit box is as it describes at hitbox syle controller. It was born of my enjoyment of tekken and a the price of other fightpads/hitboxes, often over 100 dollars. So I decided to create my own. Currently there is only one prototype () of the openHitbox. However a version two is in the works now featureing a pcb and hotswap sockets, and I also would like to create a version that supports [[https://www.gateron.com/collections/low-profile-series |Gateron Low Profile Switches]] the software side of things will be powered by [[https://gp2040-ce.info | GP2040-CE]] and for the mcu a  [[https://www.waveshare.com/rp2040-zero.htm |Waveshare RP2040-Zero]] will be used becuase it has enough pins to support all of the buttons used by a hitbox. The [[https://www.waveshare.com/rp2040-zero.htm |Waveshare RP2040-Zero]] also supports usb which is allways a nice addition.
